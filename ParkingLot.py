Problem: Rearrange an array using swap with 0. 

You have two arrays src, tgt, containing two permutations of the numbers 0..n-1. You would like to rearrange src so that it equals tgt. 
The only allowed operations is “swap a number with 0”, e.g. {1,0,2,3} -> {1,3,2,0} (“swap 3 with 0”). 
Write a program that prints to stdout the list of required operations. 

Practical application: 

Imagine you have a parking place with n slots and n-1 cars numbered from 1..n-1. The free slot is represented by 0 in the problem. 
If you want to rearrange the cars, you can only move one car at a time into the empty slot, which is equivalent to “swap a number with 0”. 

Example: 
src={1,0,2,3}; tgt={0,2,3,1};
