Problem:

Given a set S of 10^6 doubles. Find a number X so that the [X, X+1) half-open real interval contains as many elements of S as possible.
For example, given this subset: 2.7, 0.23, 8.32, 9.65, -6.55, 1.55, 1.98, 7.11, 0.49, 2.75, 2.95, -96.023, 0.14, 8.60, 
the value X desired is 1.98 because there are 4 values in the range 1.98 to 2.97999 (1.98, 2.7, 2.75, 2.95)
